Xin Yi Chen is a third year Computer Science student specializing in Software Engineering Stream at the University of Toronto. She developed excellent programming skills in Python, C, Java and problem solving skills in the past two years, resulting in the completion of dozens of individual and group projects. As a self-motivated learner, she is currently studying Mobile App and Web programming on her own. She also took an active part in hackathons to meet new friends and learn new things.
