## About the team

<Todo>

* Team’s name, a team logo, and a picture of the entire team. (Hint: the easiest way to do this is to screenshot a video meeting!) What are the team’s goals in this course? What are your team’s strengths? [5 marks]

Team’s goal: 4.0

Team’s strengths:


* Introduce the team members: for each member, include a picture and a 150-word biography. A biography should describe you as a professional: think of how you would introduce yourself to a prospective employee. [2 marks each]
* Discuss every aspect of the team agreement and submit all your decisions. [5 marks]

## Team Agreement

### Communication

* Method: Discord, WeChat
* Response times: within 12 hours
* Regular meeting times: Thursday 3-4 (with TA), Saturday starting from 10am (duration is subject to change, ~1h)
* Meeting attendance: All meetings are mandatory except for essential reasons
* Running meetings: discord
* Meeting preparation: will be notified via discord if any


### Division of work

During the meeting, tasks at the current stage of the project will be discussed. Each member takes on tasks and completes them based on their own choice.

* Scrum master (if we need one): Yifei Yin
* Contacting TA: Ruixin Zhuang
* Submit: Yiyang Zhou
* Review: by all team members
* When to submit: 12 hours before the deadline in case of technical issues


### Contingency planning

* If a team member drops out, his/her work will be distributed among the rest of team members.
* If a team member is sick, we will make decisions together according to the specific situation.
* If a team member consistently misses meetings, he/she must provides a valid reason for missing the meetings and notifies everyone one day ahead of the meeting starts. Failure to do so will result in serious punishment (we will discuss punishment if this really happens).
* We will review each submission to prevent academic dishonesty.
