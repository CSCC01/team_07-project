Yifei is a third-year undergraduate student from University of Toronto Scarborough, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a speciality in Software Engineering. He has strong interests in software development and have become familiar with all kinds of technology stacks and tools, including NodeJS, React, Python. Last year, he completed a 4-month co-op internship as a Full Stack Developer, where he gained lots of experience in web development particularly in Rails and Angular. He also had the wonderful opportunity to lead an entirely new mobile project using React Native, during which time he migrated an existing clinical form builder onto mobile, making the user experience consistent across apps without scarifies flexibility or functionality. He has also explored other fields in computer science, including data science (STAA57), machine learning (CSCC10), computer vision. Other than programming, his hobbies also include snowboarding, hiking and playing ping-pong.


### Joe

Ruixin Zhuang (Joe) is a third-year student specialized in Computer Science, Software Engineering stream. At his early age, he found computer hardware and software to be fascinating and decided to choose learn Computer Science when he entered UTSC. With his participation in development of various on campus and off campus projects, he gained proficient programming skills in multiple languages including C, Python, Java. He also found web application to be interesting and powerful after completed a course website project using HTML, CSS, jQuery, Flask and SQLite3.

He is confident that he will spare no effort in contributing to the team and try his best on everything.


### Katrina

Xin Yi Chen is a third-year Computer Science student specializing in Software Engineering stream at the University of Toronto. She developed excellent programming skills in Python, C, Java and problem solving skills in the past two years, resulting in the completion of dozens of individual and group projects. As a self-motivated learner, she is currently studying Mobile App and Web programming on her own. She also took an active part in hackathons to meet new friends and learn new things. In Hack the Valley 4, she collaborated with Yifei and another teammate and built an item tracking and online chatting platform app that allows people within a region to share commodities freely and conveniently. Right now, she is participating in the Google Girl Hackathon and working on solutions with software technology which can help the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic to “help people stay safe, informed and connected” in a team of 5. Off campus, she worked as a python tutor. While this part-time job reinforced her knowledge and improved her communication skills, she is proud of the fact that she is able to spark students’ passion in terms of programming.
